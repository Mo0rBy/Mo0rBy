# Hi there!

## 👨‍💻 A little bit about me

My name is Will and welcome to my Github page!

I graduated from [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) with a Masters in Chemical Engineering. While completing my degree I fell in love with code and that has lead me to pursue a life in software!

I am a DevOps/Site Reliabilty Engineer with a specialization in creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to produce functional and secure container images as well as orchestrating those images in a Kubernetes cluster. I really enjoy using Helm to manage my Kubeneres deployments. 
I've also dabbled in some automated testing, including functional testing as well as infrastructure testing for Helm charts and terraform.

I'm a huge fan of open source tools! Here is my 1st PR for an open source project! And here is a 2nd that is yet to be merged.

I have a crazy wild music taste! I'm mostly listening to some heavy metal type stuff in the gym and then some lofi chill rap type stuff when I'm coding or any other time, some basic indie.

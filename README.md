# Hi there!

## üë®‚Äçüíª A little bit about me

My name is Will and welcome to my Github page!

I graduated from Newcastle University with a Masters in Chemical Engineering. While completing my degree I fell in love with code and that has lead me to pursue a life in software!

I am a DevOps/Site Reliabilty Engineer with a specialization in creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to produce functional and secure container images as well as orchestrating those images in a Kubernetes cluster (I love to use Helm or this, it's amazing!). 
I've also dabbled in some automated testing, including functional testing as well as infrastructure testing for Helm charts and terraform.

I'm a huge fan of open source tools! But I've only contributed to them by opening issues of bugs I have found and I need to do more to contribute fixes for these bugs.

I have a crazy wild music taste! I'm mostly listening to some heavy metal type stuff in the gym and then some lofi chill rap type stuff when I'm coding or any other time, some basic indie.
